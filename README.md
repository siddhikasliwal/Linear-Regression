# Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a type of statistical analysis used to predict the relationship between two variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, and aims to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship

In a simple linear regression, there is one independent variable and one dependent variable. The model estimates the slope and intercept of the line of best fit, which represents the relationship between the variables. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.

Linear regression is a quiet and the simplest statistical regression method used for predictive analysis in machine learning. Linear regression shows the linear relationship between the independent(predictor) variable i.e. X-axis and the dependent(output) variable i.e. Y-axis, called linear regression. If there is a single input variable X(independent variable), such linear regression is called simple linear regression.
